# Sleep-detection-and-HRV-analysis
Implementation of a sleep detection algorithm using accelerometer data, followed by an evaluation of HRV features during sleep and wake using PPG data. Both PPG and accelerometer data were recorded in 10 healthy subjects using the Empatica E4 wrist-wearable device.
